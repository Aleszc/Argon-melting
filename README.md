# Argon-melting
This program simulates movement of argon atoms for set temperatures and number of atoms. Obtained data can be visualised via programs such as Jmol etc.
Parameters of the simulation can be changed in the 'parameters.txt' file, where:n - number of atoms along the crystal edge, m - atom mass, a - lattice constant, f - elasticity coefficient, e - minimum potential value, r - initial interatomic distance, T - initial temperature, tau - time step, S_o - number of steps needed for thermalization, S_d - number of steps of proper dynamics.
